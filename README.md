## Project Overview
AtliQ Mart, a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India, is currently operational in three cities: Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodara. The company plans to expand to other metros and Tier 1 cities within the next two years.
However, AtliQ Mart is facing a critical challenge where some key customers have not renewed their annual contracts due to service-related issues. Specifically, vital products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full repeatedly, adversely affecting customer satisfaction and service reliability.
To address this, management required a robust analytical solution to monitor critical supply chain service metrics—namely On-Time Delivery (OT%), In-Full Delivery (IF%), and On-Time In-Full Delivery (OTIF%)—on a daily basis for all customers. This would enable rapid identification and resolution of service lapses before proceeding with expansion.

## Project Objective
Design and develop a Supply Chain Service Excellence Dashboard that:
- Monitors daily service level KPIs (OT%, IF%, OTIF%) at customer, product, and city levels.
- Compares actual delivery performance against predefined customer-specific target service levels.
- Provides intuitive, interactive visualizations to quickly identify service issues by customers, products, and locations.
- Enables supply chain managers to take timely corrective actions to improve service quality.
- Supports strategic decision-making for planned geographic expansion by ensuring service reliability in existing markets.

## Dashboard Features
- Overview Dashboard:
Displays key KPIs with trendline charts tracking OT%, IF%, and OTIF% over time, and breakdowns by city and product for high-level insight.

- Customer Service Analysis:
Matrix and visual comparisons showing customer-wise delivery performance against targets, highlighting at-risk customers with conditional formatting.

- Product Performance:
Analyzes fulfillment rates and delivery issues by product category and SKU.

- Order Trend Insights:
Time-series charts and decomposition visuals for diagnosing root causes of service level drops.

## Impact & Skills Demonstrated
- Timely identification: Enables daily monitoring, allowing the supply chain team to proactively address customer service issues.
- Customer retention: Provides actionable insights to improve service levels for key customers, supporting contract renewals.
- Expansion readiness: Establishes a reliable data-driven foundation to ensure service quality before geographic growth.
- Analytical mindset: Supply chain KPI development, root cause analysis, and performance measurement.
- Business acumen: Understanding FMCG supply chain challenges and management reporting needs.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates my ability to design and implement a comprehensive supply chain performance monitoring system addressing real-world FMCG operational challenges. The Supply Chain Service Excellence Dashboard empowers the team to enhance customer satisfaction and positions AtliQ Mart for successful expansion into new markets.
